## ROUGH DRAFT ##

Definition of objectives and goals. Don't let the box get to a destination AFTER you've clicked it.
***goal: The distance from 2 locations will not be equadistant to all unless the window is a square.
        The timing value must take this into account as a scale factor.

*Fixed Header and Footer div to populate links menu items/links. 50px.
*A Stage in between Header and Footer with the remaining spaced filled up.
*A box that is populated with a margin of 10px inside the Stage.
*This box should be 1/4th the size of the Stage along with minus the margin.
*The box will move from one corner of the content to the other linearly.
**Resizing the window will make the box be the smallest of the 1/4th dimensions minus the margin.
