Local goals for personal projects.


## ROUGH DRAFT ##

Definition of objectives and goals. Don't let the box get to a destination AFTER you've clicked it.
***goal: The distance from 2 locations will not be equadistant to all unless the window is a square.
        The timing value must take this into account as a scale factor.

*Fixed Header and Footer div to populate links menu items/links. 50px.
*A Stage in between Header and Footer with the remaining spaced filled up.
*A box that is populated with a margin of 10px inside the Stage.
*This box should be 1/4th the size of the Stage along with minus the margin.
*The box will move from one corner of the content to the other linearly.
**Resizing the window will make the box be the smallest of the 1/4th dimensions minus the margin.

More.
*Start and end screen.
-Start: Start button and credits.
-End Screen: Restart button.
*The box can be interrupted to move to a different location by a mouse click.
-upon clicking it will choose 1 of the 3 remaining locations to go to.
*The boxes new interpolation function will be randomly selected upon click.

More!
*Every click will change the timing value of how fast it will try to get to the new location...
Making it faster and faster and eventually you can't click it.
*Every click is a point. So display that in the topRight of the Header.
*A DropDown available for 'Interactions'=> MouseClick and MouseOver.
-Changing the box Interaction: The box can be interrupted by a mouseOver or a mouseClick, this 
drop down will change this callback function.
